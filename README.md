# Fluid Properties Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict fluid properties using various machine learning techniques. By leveraging data on viscosity, density, temperature, and pressure, we develop models to accurately predict fluid behavior. This project serves as an introduction to applying machine learning in the field of fluid dynamics.
